Development guidelines
----------------------

For information about development conventions, practices, and infrastructure, please see `the executablebooks/ development guidelines <https://github.com/executablebooks/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Sphinxcontrib-tomyst's *codebase*, take the following steps:

Clone and install the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    git clone https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-tomyst.git


Next, install:

::

    pip install -e .[testing,code_style]


This will install Sphinxcontrib-tomyst locally, along with the packages needed to test it
as well as packages for ensuring code style.

Install the pre-commit hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sphinxcontrib-tomyst uses `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to ensure code style
and quality before a commit is made. This ensures that the look and feel remain consistent over time and across developers. ``pre-commit`` is installed when you
install Sphinxcontrib-tomyst with ``pip install -e .[code_style]``.

To enable ``pre-commit`` for your clone, run the following from the repository root:

::

    pre-commit install


From now on, when you make a commit to Sphinxcontrib-tomyst, ``pre-commit`` will ensure that your
code looks correct according to a few checks.

Run the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For code tests, sphinxcontrib-tomyst uses `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org>`_.
You may run all the tests with the following command:

::

    pytest
