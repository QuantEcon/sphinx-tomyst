# Testing Document

This is a document that contains various python code blocks in addition
to non-python code blocks

## Python

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
```

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np
```

```{code-cell} python3
import numpy as np
```

```{code-cell} ipython
import numpy as np
```

## Non-Python

```{code-block} julia
Pkg.update()
```

```{code-block} none
Some Plain Text
```

## Options

Test no-execute passthrough to code-blocks

```{code-block} python
import numpy as np
```

Test skip-test passthrough to code-cells

```{code-cell} python
---
tags: [raises-exception]
---
print(thisfails)
```

Test hide-output passthrough to code-cells

```{code-cell} python3
---
tags: [hide-output]
---
from random import uniform

samples = [uniform(0, 1) for i in range(10)]
F = ECDF(samples)
F(0.5)  # Evaluate ecdf at x = 0.5
```

### Combinations

```{code-cell} python3
---
tags: [raises-exception, hide-output]
---
from random import uniform

samples = [uniform(0, 1) for i in range(10)]
F = ECDF(samples)
F(0.5)  # Evaluate ecdf at x = 0.5
```
