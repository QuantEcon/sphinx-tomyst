# Change Log

## v0.1.0a 2020-12-22

This is the **initial release** of `sphinx-tomyst` and should be considered `alpha` status.

[sphinx-tomyst](https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinx-tomyst) is
a Sphinx extension that enables projects to be converted to a
[myst](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax.html) project.

[Documentation](https://sphinx-tomyst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) is available
for [configuration and options](https://sphinx-tomyst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html)
that are available.

The extension is setup to target `myst_nb` by **default** which makes `myst` files that are compatible
with [jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book)
